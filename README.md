# SMS Fix Magisk Module for Samsung Galaxy A23 5G

A Magisk module that fixes incoming SMS on Galaxy A23 5G by rolling back the RIL libraries to those from firmware `A236EXXS4CWE2`.

**⚠️ Do not install this module if you don't have problems receiving texts, or if you are on firmware `A236EXXS4CWE2` or earlier. See the note below if you don't have the global model.**

## Note for A236B or A236M or A236x it is not A236E!
This module may be unnecessary for your model and instead prevent the RIL from working at all. You can still try it if you have issues with SMS, and report back to [our Telegram group](t.me/Galaxy6375_chat) if it works.

## Installation
Download the [latest version](https://github.com/blueskychan-dev/A236E-ril-rollback/releases/latest) and flash it on the Magisk app or a custom recovery.

## Issues
Please report any issue you experienced by opening an issue or telling us on [our Telegram group](https://t.me/Galaxy6375_chat).
